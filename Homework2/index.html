  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am currently a student at UCLA coding bootcamp. I find coding computers very interesting. I also find coding extremly challenging.

</p>

<p>I went to Chapman University for undergraduate where I studied business with an emphasis in Advertising. I was in at University from 2001 through 2005. I then went on to work in the Advertising field. I worked for a large Advertising Agency called Heil-Brice Retail Advertising. After doing that for several years I decided to start my own high end clothing line. This was extremely challenging.
</p>

<p>Starting my own business was very challenging. I had to do all the work myself and I hired an assistant designer. After owning my own business I retired because I had made some very good investments that I could live off of. I am now interested in learning coding so I can build my own app. The business for computer programmers is booming. Instead of hiring a company I decided to learn coding so I could do it myself.</p>

<p>Coding is extremly difficult and I am not just learning one language, I must know several. I also have to learn how the languages like HTML, CSS, Java and many others work together. I am a clothing designer and investor. I know so little about how computers work and how to direct a computer with code. I am up for the challenge though and realize with time and a lot of work I will be able to create simple things with code. I also plan on putting as much time into this that I can. This first homework assignment was very challenging and I have spent 20 plus hours trying to figure it out. I hired a tutor which has been very helpful because I need someone to sit with me and show me how the languages work and work together. This is the most challenging thing I have ever done. I am excited though to learn something so tough. Also to know just a little in such an amazing indusrty makes me excited. I pray that I will be able to continue to pick up on the important knowlege this course has to offer and be patient with myself. Thank you for reading this and I look forward to learning more.</p>
